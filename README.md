FreshCask
=========

FreshCask is the *core* of FreshDB, which is a Bitcask based lightweight key-value database. 

Inspired by my friend's nickname, that's reason why it's called "FreshCask".

Using C++ as core developing language, designed for my ~~fxxking~~ annoying data structure curriculum execrise.

And generally, there should be an GUI database explorer, but I, myself, really consider that as impossiblity. :D

Required to finish this project in two weeks *only by myself*, I can defnitely predict that that two weeks would be something really like hell.
